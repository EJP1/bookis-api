# Itroduction

This is a really simple project based on an express app using Typescript.
Currently only has one service (file handeling) and client (dropbox)

This project uses yarn.

To run locally run:

```bash
yarn
yarn start:dev
```

## Notes

The client uses a hardcoded access token for the specific dropbox account. This may be invalidated after some time, if so contact the author.
